The DFS69 is a device that allows you to digitize/scan your 35mm and 120 film using a DSLR or Mirrorless camera.  It is intended to be a companion accessory to the MP120TC 3D printed 120 technical camera, but can work with many film formats.

## Why I Designed The DFS69
The MP120TC technical camera uses 120 film and because darkrooms are not as common as they used to be, most people will want to work with their resulting images using a computer.  Unfortunately, 120 film scanners are not easy to get and if you can get one, it will be expensive.  Most people have access to a DSLR or Mirrorless camera that can be pressed into service to photograph the film images captured by the MP120TC (and other cameras).  

## How It Got Its Name
The DFS69 is essentially an acronym: **D**SLR **F**ilm **S**canner **6**x**9**

## Multi-format film scanning
The DFS69 was designed to support several film formats, including: 35mm, 6x4.5, 6x6, 6x7, 6x8, and 6x9
